    "dialogs.terra_entity.guide.12": "If you want to survive, you need to make weapons and build a house. First, cut down trees and collect wood.",
    "dialogs.terra_entity.guide.13": "After you have a sword, you can try to collect some gel from slimes. Use wooden sticks and gel to make torches!",
    "dialogs.terra_entity.guide.14": "If you have some ores, you need to smelt them into ingots before you can use them to make items. This requires a furnace!",

    "dialogs.terra_entity.nurse.2": "Hey, has the Arms Dealer ever mentioned going to see a doctor or something? Just asking.",
    "dialogs.terra_entity.nurse.3": "Got into trouble with the thugs again?",

    "dialogs.terra_entity.painter.3": "No, no, no... There are many kinds of gray! Don't make me start...",
    "dialogs.terra_entity.painter.4": "I hope it stops raining. The paint still hasn't dried. It would be a disaster if it rains!",
    "dialogs.terra_entity.painter.5": "I tried organizing a paintball war, but everyone just wanted food and decorations.",
    "dialogs.terra_entity.party_girl.0": "We have to talk. It's... it's about parties.",
    "dialogs.terra_entity.party_girl.1": "I can't decide what I like more: parties, or after-parties.",
    "dialogs.terra_entity.party_girl.2": "We should set up a blinkroot party, and we should also set up an after-party.",
    "dialogs.terra_entity.party_girl.3": "Put up a disco ball and then I'll show you how to party.",
    "dialogs.terra_entity.party_girl.4": "I went to Sweden once, they party hard, why aren't you like that?",
    "dialogs.terra_entity.party_girl.5": "My name's Party Girl but people call me party pooper. Yeah I don't know, it sounds cool though.",
    "dialogs.terra_entity.party_girl.6": "Do you party? Sometimes? Hm, okay then we can talk...",
    "dialogs.terra_entity.traveling_merchant.0": "Hmm, you look like you could use an Angel Statue! They slice, and dice, and make everything nice!",
    "dialogs.terra_entity.traveling_merchant.1": "I don't refund for \"buyer's remorse...\" Or for any other reason, really.",
