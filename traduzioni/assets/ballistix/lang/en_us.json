The energy on the other hand determines what amount of blocks in that area will be destroyed starting at the center of the blast. The harder a block, the more energy the blast will lose destroying it, reducing the effective area of the explosive. For example, a blast with a small radius and a high energy will destroy a smaller area, but will be able to more effectively destroy the blocks inside of its radius.

The catch however is that it takes 5 explosive warheads to launch in the first place, and can only be fired from the Missile Silo.

The Railgun Turret can engage both missiles and entities. The steel rod will deal 20 damage on hitting and entity, but the turret must have a clear line of sight to engage! The turret is powered from the bottom. If Electrodynamics is installed, it will require Joules at the appropriate Voltage. Otherwise it will use FE.",
    "guidebook.ballistix.chapter.missiledefense.samturret1": "The SAM Turret specializes in long-range missile defense. Its base maximum range can also be further upgraded with Range Upgrades. The %1$s it fires is homing so long as the radar the turret is linked to remains operational, thus increasing the chance of a successful hit. A SAM has a %2$s chance to destroy a missile upon impact! Upon firing, the turret will need to wait %3$s ticks before it is able to fire again. The effectiveness of the turret comes at a price however, as it can only engage missiles. Also, once a missile is within the minimum range of the turret, it will not be able to fire! The turret is powered from the bottom. If Electrodynamics is installed, it will require Joules at the appropriate Voltage. Otherwise it will use FE.",
    "guidebook.ballistix.chapter.missiledefense.searchradar1": "The Search Radar is a lower-powered radar that can be utilized as an early warning device. It is able to detect missiles or ESM Towers out to a range of %s blocks. Due to the block being a weaker radiation source, the ESM Tower will only be able to determine that a Search Radar is in its detection range without listing any coordinates. The Radar can detect an unlimited amount of incoming missiles or ESM Towers, but more importantly however, the Radar will emit a redstone signal upon detecting something. It will also read a comparator signal of 0 if only detecting missiles, a signal of 8 if it is only detecting ESM Towers, and will read a signal of 15 if it is detecting both missiles and ESM Towers. You can therefore use these redstone signals to automate when your defenses flip on!",
    "guidebook.ballistix.chapter.missiledefense.searchradar2": "It is important to note however that the Search Radar does not discriminate between the missiles it detects, meaning it can detect the missiles you launch as well! To prevent this, you can whitelist certain launch frequencies to exclude them from detection. To add frequencies, select the Frequency Manager tab inside the radar's GUI:",
    "guidebook.ballistix.chapter.missiledefense.searchradar3": "Note the whitelist mode must be enabled for the frequencies to actually be ignored. Disabling whitelist mode won't wipe any stored frequencies! The Fire Control Radar has an identical whitelist feature for reference. The Search Radar must be placed above-ground in order to work and is powered from the bottom. If Electrodynamics is installed, it will require Joules at the appropriate Voltage. Otherwise it will use FE.",

    "guidebook.ballistix.chapter.missileoffense.l1.1": "Ballistix offers two main methods of missile offense. The first of these is the Missile Silo. The Missile Silo is a multiblock used to launch various missiles with different types of warheads. The Silo is composed of three different blocks:",
    "guidebook.ballistix.chapter.missileoffense.l1.2": "Each come in three tiers which provide successive buffs to the silo and any tier can be combined with the other tier, with a Tier 3 set being the strongest missile silo possible!",
    "guidebook.ballistix.chapter.missileoffense.l2": "The %1$s is used to provide targeting information to the Missile Silo and instructs it to fire. It will require power to function however. The %1$s can be instructed to launch either manually via the GUI, a redstone signal, or by using a Laser Designator. The silo will be on cooldown upon successfully firing a missile. However it will fire again once the cooldown is over if it still has a redstone signal.",
    "guidebook.ballistix.chapter.missileoffense.l3": "The %1$s is the cheapest, but can only specify the X and Z coordinates of a target. The %2$s is more expensive, but gains the ability to specify the Y variant. Also, the missile will detonate once it reaches the specified Y value if launched from a Tier 2 or higher, allowing for more precise strikes. The %3$s is the most expensive, but gains the ability to also specify the launch frequency of the silo and the missile.",
    "guidebook.ballistix.chapter.missileoffense.l4": "The %1$s is what holds the missile and accompanying warhead. It should be noted that a missile must have a warhead to be able to launch. The %2$s has a maximum range of %3$s blocks, and can support up to Tier 1 missiles and explosives. The %4$s has a maximum range of %5$s blocks, and can support up to Tier 2 missiles and explosives. The %6$s has a maximum range of %7$s blocks, and can support up to Tier 3 missiles and explosives.",
    "guidebook.ballistix.chapter.missileoffense.l5": "On the subject of tiers, missiles can support explosives of tiers less than or equal to their tier. This means a Tier 2 missile can support a Tier 1 or Tier 2 explosive warhead, but not a Tier 3 warhead. It is important to keep this in mind when attempting to launch an attack!",
    "guidebook.ballistix.chapter.missileoffense.l6": "The %1$s is used to increase the accuracy of the missile silo when launching a missile. A Missile Silo is more than capable of launching a missile without a support frame. However this will incur an inaccuracy of %2$s blocks. This means the missile will land within a square radius of %3$s blocks of the specified target. The %4$s will reduce this inaccuracy to %5$s blocks. The %6$s will reduce the inaccuracy further to %7$s blocks, while the %8$s will reduce inaccuracy all the way to %9$s blocks!",
    "guidebook.ballistix.chapter.missileoffense.l7": "To assembly the Missile Silo, first place the %1$s. Then place the %2$s next to the %1$s facing the center of the block. Finally place the %3$s opposite the %2$s and facing the center of the %1$s. The %2$s will require power to function. If Electrodynamics is installed, it will require Joules at the appropriate Voltage. Otherwise the block can use FE from any mod. Items can be fed in from any side of the %1$s. Missiles launched from a Missile Silo will fly up to 500 blocks, travel horizontally till they near the target, and then arc back down.",
    "guidebook.ballistix.chapter.missileoffense.l8": "The second method of missile offense Ballistix offers is the %1$s. The VLS is a compact version of the Tier 1 Silo with the missile targeting features of a %2$s. While its range is limited to only %3$s blocks, it allows you to set up mobile attach sites with ease. These can then be used in combination with your main Missile Silos, allowing you attach the enemy from multiple directions. Furthermore, since the VLS can only fire Tier 1 missiles, it can be used to wear down enemy defenses while your more valuable missiles are still on the way!",
    "guidebook.ballistix.chapter.missileoffense.l9": "The VLS requires power to function. If Electrodynamics is installed, it will require Joules at the appropriate Voltage. Otherwise it will use FE from any mod. Power and items can be fed in from any side. Missiles fired from the VLS will launch vertically, arc towards their target, and then travel in a straight line.",
